x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x + 6 (-2,2)

1 = 5
2 = 0
3 = -3
4 = 2

Are we doing only graphs or word problems as well?

I'm pretty sure it's all graph problems only because that's what Mr.Plotts only showed us. We also have to make them to be able to solve it (with different difficulty) easily as well.

x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x + 1 (-1,2)

-1 = -6
0 = 1
1 = 0
2 = -3

x^5 - 7x^3 + 5x - 1 (-2,1)

-2 = 13
-1 = 0
0 = -1
1 = -2
